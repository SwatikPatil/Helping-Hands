# Helping Hands
A donation website 


There is a considerable problem of food and unused items being wasted in our country.This website will let people donate items they want and those in need can get these items.

We have two types of users: 
The Donor: They are the people who wish to donate things. It could be things like books, clothes, stationary , money , shoes.. etc.

The Receiver: These are the people who are in need of items that are donated.

The receivers will be able to see what items are being donated and then can request for the same.
